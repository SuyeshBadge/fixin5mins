# Active Context: Puppeteer Timeout Issue

## Current Problem
The application experienced Puppeteer errors during image generation:

**Original Error (FIXED):**
```
ProtocolError: Network.enable timed out. Increase the 'protocolTimeout' setting in launch/connect calls for a higher timeout if needed.
```

**New Error (ADDRESSING):**
```
TargetCloseError: Protocol error (Target.setAutoAttach): Target closed
```

This indicates the browser launches but closes during connection establishment.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Default Timeout Too Low**: Puppeteer's default protocol timeout (30s) may be insufficient in Docker environment
2. **Docker Environment**: Alpine Linux + Chromium setup may have slower initialization
3. **Resource Constraints**: Container may have limited resources affecting browser startup
4. **Network Configuration**: Docker networking may add latency to browser protocol communication

## Current Configuration
- Using Puppeteer 24.6.1
- Running in Docker with Node 18 Alpine
- Chromium browser installed via apk
- Current timeout settings: 30s for page loading, no protocol timeout set

## Impact
- Image generation fails completely
- Instagram posts cannot be created
- Scheduled jobs fail

## Implemented Solutions
✅ **Protocol Timeout**: Added 60-second timeout to Puppeteer launch options
✅ **Retry Logic**: Implemented exponential backoff retry mechanism (3 attempts)
✅ **Docker Optimization**: Enhanced Chromium flags for container environment
✅ **Resource Management**: Added memory/CPU limits and shared memory size
✅ **Error Handling**: Improved error reporting and validation
✅ **Connection Stability**: Removed problematic flags (--single-process, --no-zygote)
✅ **Browser Health Checks**: Added connection verification and health monitoring
✅ **Safe Browser Lifecycle**: Implemented proper browser cleanup and timeout handling
✅ **Enhanced Docker Config**: Added tmpfs, increased resources, security options

## Changes Made
1. **html2image-puppeteer.ts**: 
   - Added protocol timeout, retry logic, optimized Chromium flags
   - Removed problematic flags causing connection issues
   - Added browser health checks and safe close functionality
   - Enhanced error handling with proper cleanup
2. **docker-compose.yml**: 
   - Added resource limits and shared memory configuration
   - Added tmpfs mount for better performance
   - Increased memory limits and added security options
3. **imageGenerator.ts**: Enhanced error handling for template rendering

## Expected Results
- Eliminates `ProtocolError: Network.enable timed out` errors
- Eliminates `Target.setAutoAttach: Target closed` errors  
- More reliable browser initialization in Docker
- Better error recovery and logging
- Improved resource utilization

## Latest Container-Specific Fixes
✅ **Debian Base Image**: Switched from Alpine to Debian for better Puppeteer compatibility
✅ **Google Chrome**: Using Google Chrome instead of Chromium for stability
✅ **Container Init**: Added proper init system for process management
✅ **Enhanced Browser Args**: Container-optimized Chrome arguments
✅ **Debug Tools**: Added comprehensive debugging and testing scripts
✅ **Resource Management**: Proper memory limits and shared memory configuration

# Active Context

## Current Focus

We have just enhanced the content generation script with a mock mode to make it work without requiring an external AI service. This improvement addresses the error we encountered when trying to run the script with the AI service unavailable. The script now:

1. Has a new `--mock` flag to force using mock content instead of the AI service
2. Automatically falls back to mock content if the AI service fails
3. Provides topic-specific predefined content templates for common topics
4. Generates generic content for any custom topic

Previously, we created a comprehensive automation script (generateAndPostContent.ts) that brings together all the components of our system to provide an end-to-end solution for content generation and Instagram posting. This script:

1. Uses the ContentGenerationService to generate emotional content in our standardized format
2. Creates images using the template system with the quote-red template
3. Posts the content to Instagram with appropriate captions and hashtags
4. Provides command-line options for flexibility and control

The EmotionalContentFormat consists of:
- emotionalHook: Connects with the audience's pain point or emotional state
- actionStep: Provides a concrete action that can be completed in 5 minutes
- emotionalReward: Describes the emotional benefit of taking the action

We are also continuing to develop and enhance the template system, particularly the quote-red template for Instagram content. Our focus has been on improving the visual design, typography, and content structure to create more engaging posts. The template system now supports both traditional quotes and the new emotional structure format with hooks, action steps, and rewards.

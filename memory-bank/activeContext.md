# Active Context

## Current Focus

We have been enhancing the project's content creation capabilities by adding a new motivation-accent template that features a clean, modern design with accent-highlighted words in colored boxes. The template is designed for motivational quotes and action-oriented content, using a warm cream/beige background with bold typography and strategic highlighting of key words. The design includes distinctive visual elements such as an orange accent dot, arrow, and black dots to create a contemporary, professional aesthetic.

Previously, we created a self-love-gradient template that features an elegant gradient background with modern typography. The template is designed for self-care and personal growth content, using a soothing gradient background that transitions from light blue/lavender to pinkish-orange. The template includes proper dynamic font sizing to accommodate various content lengths and uses "The Young Serif" and "Burgues Script" inspired fonts for a premium aesthetic.

We've also been enhancing the project's capabilities by adding proper Cloudinary integration and fixing Instagram posting issues. We've updated the configuration file to include Cloudinary keys and integrated Cloudinary image hosting into the content generation workflow. Additionally, we've fixed an issue with Instagram posting by implementing a dedicated single image posting function that works correctly with the Instagram API instead of trying to use the carousel function for single images. We've also updated the heading in the template from "Quick Fix" to "Fix your life in 5 minutes" to better reflect the brand messaging.

We also enhanced the content generation script with a mock mode to make it work without requiring an external AI service. This improvement addresses the error we encountered when trying to run the script with the AI service unavailable. The script now:

1. Has a new `--mock` flag to force using mock content instead of the AI service
2. Automatically falls back to mock content if the AI service fails
3. Provides topic-specific predefined content templates for common topics
4. Generates generic content for any custom topic

We created a comprehensive automation script (generateAndPostContent.ts) that brings together all the components of our system to provide an end-to-end solution for content generation and Instagram posting. This script:

1. Uses the ContentGenerationService to generate emotional content in our standardized format
2. Creates images using the template system with various templates including the new self-love-gradient
3. Posts the content to Instagram with appropriate captions and hashtags
4. Provides command-line options for flexibility and control

The EmotionalContentFormat consists of:
- emotionalHook: Connects with the audience's pain point or emotional state
- actionStep: Provides a concrete action that can be completed in 5 minutes
- emotionalReward: Describes the emotional benefit of taking the action

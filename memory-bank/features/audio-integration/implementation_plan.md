# Audio Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation plan for adding relevant audio to Instagram posts in the FixIn5Mins application. It provides a detailed roadmap for developers, including architecture decisions, technical requirements, and a timeline for delivery.

## 1. Architecture

### 1.1 System Components

![Architecture Diagram](architecture_placeholder.png)

The audio integration feature will consist of the following components:

1. **Audio Library Service**
   - Manages audio assets and metadata
   - Provides search and filtering capabilities
   - Handles audio file storage and retrieval

2. **Content Analysis Service**
   - Analyzes post content to determine themes and emotional tone
   - Extracts keywords and context for matching
   - Maintains theme-to-audio mapping rules

3. **Video Generation Service**
   - Converts static templates to video format
   - Incorporates audio into video content
   - Handles rendering and encoding

4. **Instagram Publication Service**
   - Manages authentication with Instagram Graph API
   - Handles video upload and posting
   - Manages metadata and attribution

5. **Orchestration Service**
   - Coordinates the workflow between services
   - Handles error recovery and retries
   - Manages asynchronous processing

### 1.2 Data Flow

1. Content is generated by the existing content generation system
2. Content Analysis Service analyzes the content
3. Audio Library Service selects appropriate audio
4. Video Generation Service creates a video with the selected audio
5. Instagram Publication Service posts the video to Instagram
6. Analytics Service tracks performance and engagement

## 2. Technical Approaches

### 2.1 Audio Library Implementation

We will implement the Audio Library using:

1. **Storage**: AWS S3 for audio file storage with CloudFront CDN for distribution
2. **Database**: MongoDB for audio metadata with the following schema:
   ```
   {
     id: String,
     title: String,
     artistName: String,
     duration: Number,
     fileUrl: String,
     themes: [String],
     moods: [String],
     tempo: Number,
     popularity: Number,
     isTrending: Boolean,
     licenseType: String,
     attributionRequired: Boolean,
     attributionText: String,
     dateAdded: Date,
     lastUsed: Date,
     usageCount: Number
   }
   ```
3. **API**: RESTful API for audio track CRUD operations
4. **Search**: Elasticsearch for advanced audio search capabilities

### 2.2 Content Analysis Implementation

1. **NLP Processing**:
   - Use natural language processing libraries (spaCy, NLTK) for text analysis
   - Extract key themes, sentiment, and emotional tone
   - Implement keyword extraction and entity recognition

2. **Matching Algorithm**:
   - Vector-based similarity matching between content and audio metadata
   - Incorporate popularity and trending metrics as weighting factors
   - Use machine learning for improved matching over time

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache common analysis results
   - Pre-compute theme vectors for audio tracks
   - Use worker pools for concurrent processing

### 2.3 Video Generation Options

#### Option 1: Canva API (Recommended)

**Pros**:
- Professional design templates
- Simplified video creation
- Handles complex animations
- Managed infrastructure

**Cons**:
- API rate limitations
- Dependency on third-party service
- Less customization flexibility

**Implementation**:
- Set up OAuth authentication with Canva
- Create video templates in Canva that support audio
- Use the Canva API to programmatically:
  - Create designs from templates
  - Add content dynamically
  - Incorporate audio tracks
  - Export as MP4 videos

#### Option 2: FFmpeg Pipeline

**Pros**:
- Full control over video generation
- No third-party dependencies
- Highly customizable
- No rate limits

**Cons**:
- More complex implementation
- Requires infrastructure for video processing
- Higher maintenance burden

**Implementation**:
- Set up Node.js service with FFmpeg
- Create video frames from static templates
- Use FFmpeg to combine frames into video
- Add audio tracks with proper synchronization
- Apply effects and transitions as needed

### 2.4 Instagram Integration Implementation

1. **Authentication**:
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow with Instagram Graph API
   - Securely store and manage access tokens
   - Handle token refresh and expiration

2. **Content Upload**:
   - Implement the 3-step upload process for Instagram Reels:
     1. Initialize upload session
     2. Upload video file
     3. Complete upload and publish
   - Include proper metadata and hashtags
   - Add audio attribution when required

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement retry logic for transient failures
   - Handle API rate limits with exponential backoff
   - Provide fallback options for failed uploads

| **Mubert** | API for real-time music generation | Custom pricing | Yes | Commercial license |

**Benefits of AI-generated music**:
- Custom tracks that can be tailored to specific moods and themes
- No licensing complexity
- Unique audio that won't be used by competitors

## 2. Licensing Considerations

### 2.1 License Types

| License Type | Description | Typical Rights | Limitations | Best For |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| **Royalty-Free** | One-time payment for perpetual use | Multiple uses across projects | May have usage limitations | Regular content creation |
| **Rights-Managed** | Licensed for specific use cases | Clearly defined usage rights | Limited to specific platforms/uses | Specific campaigns |
| **Creative Commons** | Free usage with varying restrictions | Varies by license type | Attribution and commercial restrictions may apply | Limited budget projects |
| **Public Domain** | No copyright restrictions | Unlimited usage | Quality and selection limited | Unrestricted usage |
| **Subscription** | Regular payment for access to library | Multiple tracks with single subscription | Active subscription required | High-volume creation |

### 2.2 Key Licensing Terms to Consider

1. **Commercial Use**: Ensure the license explicitly permits commercial use for social media content
2. **Platform Limitations**: Check if usage is restricted to specific platforms
3. **Attribution Requirements**: Determine if and how attribution must be provided
4. **Usage Scope**: Validate if there are limitations on views, impressions, or distribution
5. **Modification Rights**: Confirm if editing, trimming, or mixing the audio is permitted
6. **Territory Restrictions**: Check for geographic limitations on content distribution
7. **Duration**: Verify if the license is perpetual or time-limited
8. **Exclusivity**: Determine if there are exclusivity clauses that could affect usage

### 2.3 Instagram-Specific Considerations

When using audio with Instagram posts, especially with Reels, consider:

1. **Instagram Terms of Service**: Ensure compliance with Instagram's terms regarding audio usage
2. **Attribution on Instagram**: Understand how attribution works within the platform
3. **Music Copyright Claims**: Be aware that Instagram may flag third-party music, even with proper licensing
4. **Business Account Limitations**: Business accounts may have more restricted access to music libraries
5. **Geographic Restrictions**: Some music may be blocked in certain countries

## 3. Audio Storage and Management

### 3.1 Storage Options

#### Cloud Storage Solutions
| Solution | Benefits | Limitations | Cost Structure | CDN Integration |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **AWS S3** | Scalable, reliable, secure | Complex pricing | Pay-per-use | CloudFront |
| **Google Cloud Storage** | Fast, global, integrated with Google services | Complex permissions | Tiered pricing | Cloud CDN |
| **Azure Blob Storage** | Enterprise integration, geo-redundancy | Complex ecosystem | Tiered with reservations | Azure CDN |
| **Cloudinary** | Media-focused, transformation capabilities | Higher cost for specialized features | Tiered with transformation quotas | Built-in CDN |
| **Backblaze B2** | Cost-effective, simple pricing | Fewer integrations | Flat rate pricing | Cloudflare integration |

#### Storage Implementation Recommendations

1. **Primary Storage**: AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN for global distribution
2. **Structure**:
   ```
   s3://fixin5mins-audio/
   ├── royalty-free/
   │   ├── motivation/
   │   ├── relaxation/
   │   ├── productivity/
   │   └── celebration/
   ├── licensed/
   │   ├── provider1/
   │   └── provider2/
   └── generated/
       ├── ai-created/
       └── custom/
   ```
3. **Naming Convention**: `{category}-{mood}-{tempo}-{id}.mp3`
4. **Metadata**: Store in MongoDB with references to S3 paths

### 3.2 Audio Processing Pipeline

To ensure consistent audio quality and format:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Format validation (MP3, WAV, etc.)
   - Quality check (bitrate, sample rate)
   - Duration verification (maximum 60 seconds for Reels)

2. **Processing**:
   - Normalization to consistent loudness (target -14 LUFS)
   - Trimming to appropriate length
   - Fade in/out application (typical 0.5s fade in, 1.5s fade out)
   - Format conversion if needed (to MP3 at 192-320kbps)

3. **Optimization**:
   - Compression for size optimization
   - ID3 tag management for metadata
   - CDN preparation for fast delivery

4. **Storage Lifecycle**:
   - Hot storage for frequently used tracks
   - Archival of unused tracks after 90 days
   - Regular backup and redundancy

## 4. Implementation Recommendations

### 4.1 Recommended Approach

1. **Primary Source**: Establish a subscription with Epidemic Sound or similar service
   - Provides high-quality tracks with clear licensing
   - Offers sufficient variety across moods and themes
   - API access for automation

2. **Secondary Source**: Instagram Music Library
   - Access through Graph API when available
   - Use for trending content to boost discovery

3. **Supplementary Source**: Selective AI-generated music

# Product Requirements Document: Instagram Post Audio Integration

## Document Information
- **Feature Name**: Relevant Audio Integration for Instagram Posts
- **Document Version**: 1.0
- **Last Updated**: May 5, 2025
- **Status**: Draft

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for a new feature that will automatically select and add relevant audio to Instagram posts created by the FixIn5Mins content generator. The feature will enhance the engagement and impact of Instagram posts by incorporating thematically appropriate audio, leveraging Instagram's Reels API to publish content with sound.

### 1.2 Background
Currently, the FixIn5Mins application generates static image posts for Instagram with emotional hooks, action steps, and rewards. Adding audio to these posts would significantly increase user engagement, as audio-visual content typically performs better on social media platforms. This aligns with Instagram's increased focus on Reels and video content.

### 1.3 Scope
This feature involves:
- Creating a system to match content themes with appropriate audio
- Converting static templates into video formats
- Integrating with audio libraries and sources
- Building a pipeline for video generation with audio
- Posting videos with audio to Instagram via the Reels API

### 1.4 Success Metrics
- 30% increase in engagement (likes, comments, shares) on posts with audio
- 25% increase in reach for audio-enhanced posts
- User feedback rating of 4+/5 for audio relevance and quality
- 95% automated matching success rate (appropriate audio for content)

## 2. User Stories

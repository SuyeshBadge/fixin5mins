# Progress Tracking

## What Works
âœ… **Core Architecture**: Service-based architecture is well-structured
âœ… **Template System**: EJS templates for different post types working
âœ… **AI Integration**: OpenAI API integration for content generation
âœ… **Docker Setup**: Container configuration and build process
âœ… **Instagram API**: Service layer for Instagram posting
âœ… **Scheduling**: Cron-based job scheduling system
âœ… **Logging**: Winston-based logging throughout application

## Current Issues
âœ… **Puppeteer Timeout**: FIXED - Added protocol timeout and retry logic
âœ… **Image Generation**: FIXED - Enhanced error handling and Docker optimization
âœ… **Post Creation**: Should now work with improved image generation

## What's Left to Build
âœ… **Fix Puppeteer Configuration**: COMPLETED - Added 60s protocol timeout
âœ… **Error Handling**: COMPLETED - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
âœ… **Performance Optimization**: COMPLETED - Docker resource limits and Chromium flags
ðŸ”§ **Monitoring**: Add health checks for browser operations

## Technical Debt
- No retry mechanism for failed image generation
- Limited error handling in Puppeteer service
- No performance monitoring for browser operations
- Missing fallback strategies for timeout scenarios

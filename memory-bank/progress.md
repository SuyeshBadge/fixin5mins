# Progress

## Current Status
The project has been updated to use local templates for image generation instead of relying on external AI services. The template system is now in place, with the configuration and management services implemented. We have successfully created the @fixin5mins post template based on the new content strategy. Additionally, we've integrated automation capabilities from the automation project, including enhanced Instagram carousel posting, Cloudinary image hosting, and improved image generation with Puppeteer. We've also added a new example script to generate sample images with random data and created a new template (quote-red) that replicates a motivational quote image with red typography on a cream background. Most recently, we've updated the configuration file to properly include Cloudinary credentials and integrated Cloudinary image hosting into the content generation and posting workflow. Furthermore, we've fixed an issue with Instagram posting by implementing a single image posting function that works properly with the Instagram API instead of trying to use the carousel function for single images. We've implemented automatic cleanup of both local and Cloudinary images after successful Instagram posting to prevent resource accumulation. We've added an LRU (Least Recently Used) topic cache system that stores 100 diverse topics and selects the least recently used one for content generation, enabling automatic topic rotation without manual intervention. The topic cache has been enhanced with category awareness to ensure content is selected from the least recently used category, maximizing topic variety and preventing similar topics from appearing consecutively. The content generation CLI now includes options to list available categories and select topics from specific categories, making the system more flexible for content creation. We've also eliminated redundant Cloudinary uploads by consolidating image management within the Instagram service to improve efficiency and reduce potential costs. We've further improved the cleanup process to remove empty image directories, preventing storage buildup from temporary image folders. Most recently, we've enhanced the AI response parsing to handle JSON content wrapped in markdown code blocks, making the system more robust against different response formats from AI services.

## What's Left to Build

1. **Template Creation**:
   - Create additional template files and assets
   - Implement additional template designs
   - Create variations of the @fixin5mins template for different themes

2. **Core Functionality Improvements**:
   - Enhanced error handling and recovery
   - Better logging and debugging
   - Performance optimizations

3. **New Features**:
   - Content scheduling capability
   - Content approval workflow
   - Additional content types and formats
   - Analytics and metrics collection
   - Web-based user interface

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - Comprehensive testing suite
   - Continuous integration setup
   - Documentation for API endpoints

## Known Issues

1. **External Dependencies**:
   - HTML2Image API still required for rendering templates to images (ALTERNATIVE: Puppeteer now available)
   - Rate limits may affect production usage
   - API changes could break functionality

2. **Configuration**:
   - Many environment variables required for setup
   - Complex Instagram/Facebook authentication process

3. **User Experience**:
   - Command-line only interface limits accessibility
   - No preview capability before posting
   - Limited feedback on content quality

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Short-term (Next Sprint)**:
   - Test the integrated Cloudinary and Instagram posting
   - Test the automatic image cleanup functionality
   - Test the LRU topic cache system with category rotation
   - Add more @fixin5mins template variations
   - Create additional template files and assets
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Improve logging for debugging
   - Test all content generation paths

2. **Medium-term**:
   - Implement content scheduling
   - Add content preview capability
   - Develop additional templates
   - Create simple content approval workflow

3. **Long-term**:
   - Build web-based user interface

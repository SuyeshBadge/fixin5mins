# Progress

## Current Status
The project has been updated to use local templates for image generation instead of relying on external AI services. The template system is now in place, with the configuration and management services implemented. We have successfully created the @fixin5mins post template based on the new content strategy. Additionally, we've integrated automation capabilities from the automation project, including enhanced Instagram carousel posting, Cloudinary image hosting, and improved image generation with Puppeteer. We've also added a new example script to generate sample images with random data and created a new template (quote-red) that replicates a motivational quote image with red typography on a cream background. Most recently, we've updated the configuration file to properly include Cloudinary credentials and integrated Cloudinary image hosting into the content generation and posting workflow. Furthermore, we've fixed an issue with Instagram posting by implementing a single image posting function that works properly with the Instagram API instead of trying to use the carousel function for single images. We've implemented automatic cleanup of both local and Cloudinary images after successful Instagram posting to prevent resource accumulation. We've added an LRU (Least Recently Used) topic cache system that stores 100 diverse topics and selects the least recently used one for content generation, enabling automatic topic rotation without manual intervention. The topic cache has been enhanced with category awareness to ensure content is selected from the least recently used category, maximizing topic variety and preventing similar topics from appearing consecutively. The content generation CLI now includes options to list available categories and select topics from specific categories, making the system more flexible for content creation. We've also eliminated redundant Cloudinary uploads by consolidating image management within the Instagram service to improve efficiency and reduce potential costs. We've further improved the cleanup process to remove empty image directories, preventing storage buildup from temporary image folders. Most recently, we've enhanced the AI response parsing to handle JSON content wrapped in markdown code blocks, making the system more robust against different response formats from AI services. We've now also implemented two solutions to prevent content overflow in images: a character limit in the content generation process and dynamic font sizing in the templates that automatically adjusts text size based on content length. We've further improved the content generation process by adding explicit formatting rules to prevent markdown formatting in the AI output and implementing a cleanup function to remove any special formatting that might interfere with display in the EJS templates. We've added a new self-love-gradient template featuring a beautiful gradient background with elegant typography for self-care and personal growth content. Our latest addition is a new motivation-accent template that features a clean cream background with highlighted accent words in gray and orange boxes, perfect for bold motivational content with a modern, clean aesthetic. We have now created a comprehensive plan and detailed implementation strategy for adding relevant audio to Instagram posts through video content, leveraging the Instagram Reels API. We've implemented an automatic daily posting scheduler that randomly posts content twice daily (morning and evening) and rotates between different templates to ensure visual variety. We have now replaced the previous AI service with OpenRouter, which provides access to free open-source models like Mistral and Llama. This integration includes a fallback mechanism to try multiple models if the primary one fails, as well as enhanced prompting for better results with smaller models. We also expanded the mock content system to provide high-quality fallbacks if all AI services are unavailable. We've now enhanced the post scheduler to use optimal posting times for each day of the week based on Instagram engagement research, with small random variations to maintain unpredictability. Most recently, we've updated the post scheduler to always schedule posts when the script starts and removed the artificial limit of 2 posts per day, allowing all optimal posting times defined for each day to be scheduled. We've also fixed an issue with the scheduler where it could randomly select the same base time multiple times, resulting in clustered posts; now it ensures each unique optimal time slot is used exactly once. Our latest addition is a new purpose-story template featuring a clean, minimalist design with bold typography, gradient background, and professional branding elements, perfect for motivational and purpose-driven content. We've now implemented Instagram Story posting functionality by consolidating all Instagram functionality into a single comprehensive service file that supports feed posts, carousels, and stories, enabling the creation and posting of 9:16 vertical story content optimized for Instagram's Story format. We've enhanced the elegant-dark template with a darker background gradient and more prominent typography, including heavier font weights, subtle text shadows, and improved color contrast for a more professional and impactful aesthetic.

## New Features

- **Added "elegant-dark" Template**: A new Instagram post template (`src/templates/elegant-dark`) has been added. 
  - **Theme**: Sophisticated dark theme with a dark gradient background.
  - **Typography**: Uses premium Google Fonts: `Playfair Display` for main headings, `Montserrat` for subheadings and body text, and `Satisfy` for accent text.
  - **Colors**: Features rich accent colors like soft gold (`#B08D57`) and deep teal (`#00695C`) for visual appeal against the dark background.
  - **Layout**: Emphasizes clean spacing and a clear visual hierarchy for a calm, premium user experience.
  - **Variables**: Supports dynamic content through EJS variables: `mainHeading`, `subHeading`, `bodyText`, `accentText`, `handle`, and `date`.
  - **Configuration**: Registered in `src/config/templateConfig.ts` with default values.
  - **Documentation**: Includes a `README.md` in its directory with usage instructions and variable descriptions.

- **Testing `elegant-dark`**: 
  - The `generateAndPostContent.ts` script is NOT directly compatible with `elegant-dark` due to differing template variable structures (e.g., `mainHeading` vs. `emotionalHook`).
  - To generate a sample of `elegant-dark` without posting, use the dedicated example script: `src/examples/elegant-dark-example.ts`. This script provides the correct variables for this template.
  - (Future enhancement: Modify `generateAndPostContent.ts` or create a new job script to make `elegant-dark` compatible with the automated content generation workflow.)

- **Enhanced `generateAndPostContent.ts` for Template Variable Flexibility**:
  - Modified `src/config/templateConfig.ts`:
    - Added an optional `contentMapping: { [key: string]: string }` field to the `Template` interface.
    - This mapping defines how EJS variables in a template should be populated from generated content (e.g., `mainHeading: "emotionalHook"`) or other sources (e.g., `accentText: "topic"`).
    - Implemented `contentMapping` for the new `elegant-dark` template and the existing `self-love-gradient` template.
  - Modified `src/jobs/generateAndPostContent.ts`:
    - The script now reads the `contentMapping` for the selected template.
    - If a mapping exists, it dynamically constructs the variables object to be passed to `generateImage` based on these mappings.
    - This allows templates with different EJS variable names (like `elegant-dark`) to correctly receive data from the content generation process (which typically produces `emotionalHook`, `actionStep`, `emotionalReward`).
    - If no `contentMapping` is found for a template, the script falls back to its previous behavior of directly assigning `emotionalHook`, etc.
    - This change makes the system more adaptable, allowing `dailyPostScheduler.ts` to correctly use templates with diverse variable structures, including `elegant-dark`.

- **Updated Command Line Argument Parsing for `generateAndPostContent.ts`**:
  - Modified `src/jobs/generateAndPostContent.ts` to recognize `--templateId` as a valid command-line argument for specifying the template, in addition to the existing `--template` and `-T` options.
  - Updated the help text displayed by `--help` or `-h` to include `--templateId`.
  - This makes the script more flexible in how the template is specified via the command line.

## In Progress
- Research and planning for video generation with audio
- Evaluating model performance and quality

## To Do
- Create prototype for converting static templates to video format
- Implement basic audio selection algorithm
- Set up audio library infrastructure
- Test Instagram Reels API integration
- Evaluate and compare free model performance

## Notes
- The template creation guide is now available in the memory-bank directory
- The guide provides all necessary information for developers to create new templates without breaking the existing system
- Audio integration documentation is available in the memory-bank/features/audio-integration directory
- Free open-source models like Mistral and Llama are now used via OpenRouter for content generation
- Optimal posting times were implemented based on research showing the best times to post on Instagram for each day of the week
- Instagram Story posting now available with 9:16 aspect ratio support
- Content generation has been completely revamped to focus on authentic empathy and real human struggles instead of viral marketing tactics with made-up statistics:
  - Updated system prompts to emphasize genuine empathy and understanding
  - Replaced shocking statements with relatable questions
  - Removed made-up statistics (like "91% of to-do lists fail...")
  - Added more realistic, achievable 5-minute actions
  - Created more conversational tone throughout all content
  - Implemented test script to verify empathetic content generation
  - Updated mock content templates to align with new authentic approach

## New Features

- **Added "elegant-dark" Template**: A new Instagram post template (`src/templates/elegant-dark`) has been added. 
  - **Theme**: Sophisticated dark theme with a dark gradient background.
  - **Typography**: Uses premium Google Fonts: `Playfair Display` for main headings, `Montserrat` for subheadings and body text, and `Satisfy` for accent text.
  - **Colors**: Features rich accent colors like soft gold (`#B08D57`) and deep teal (`#00695C`) for visual appeal against the dark background.
  - **Layout**: Emphasizes clean spacing and a clear visual hierarchy for a calm, premium user experience.
  - **Variables**: Supports dynamic content through EJS variables: `mainHeading`, `subHeading`, `bodyText`, `accentText`, `handle`, and `date`.
  - **Configuration**: Registered in `src/config/templateConfig.ts` with default values.
  - **Documentation**: Includes a `README.md` in its directory with usage instructions and variable descriptions.

- **Testing `elegant-dark`**: 
  - The `generateAndPostContent.ts` script is NOT directly compatible with `elegant-dark` due to differing template variable structures (e.g., `mainHeading` vs. `emotionalHook`).
  - To generate a sample of `elegant-dark` without posting, use the dedicated example script: `src/examples/elegant-dark-example.ts`. This script provides the correct variables for this template.
  - (Future enhancement: Modify `generateAndPostContent.ts` or create a new job script to make `elegant-dark` compatible with the automated content generation workflow.)

- **Enhanced `generateAndPostContent.ts` for Template Variable Flexibility**:
  - Modified `src/config/templateConfig.ts`:
    - Added an optional `contentMapping: { [key: string]: string }` field to the `Template` interface.
    - This mapping defines how EJS variables in a template should be populated from generated content (e.g., `mainHeading: "emotionalHook"`) or other sources (e.g., `accentText: "topic"`).
    - Implemented `contentMapping` for the new `elegant-dark` template and the existing `self-love-gradient` template.
  - Modified `src/jobs/generateAndPostContent.ts`:
    - The script now reads the `contentMapping` for the selected template.
    - If a mapping exists, it dynamically constructs the variables object to be passed to `generateImage` based on these mappings.
    - This allows templates with different EJS variable names (like `elegant-dark`) to correctly receive data from the content generation process (which typically produces `emotionalHook`, `actionStep`, `emotionalReward`).
    - If no `contentMapping` is found for a template, the script falls back to its previous behavior of directly assigning `emotionalHook`, etc.
    - This change makes the system more adaptable, allowing `dailyPostScheduler.ts` to correctly use templates with diverse variable structures, including `elegant-dark`.

  - **Colors**: Features rich accent colors like soft gold (`#B08D57`) and deep teal (`#00695C`) for visual appeal against the dark background.
  - **Layout**: Emphasizes clean spacing and a clear visual hierarchy for a calm, premium user experience.
  - **Variables**: Supports dynamic content through EJS variables: `mainHeading`, `subHeading`, `bodyText`, `accentText`, `handle`, and `date`.
  - **Configuration**: Registered in `src/config/templateConfig.ts` with default values.
  - **Documentation**: Includes a `README.md` in its directory with usage instructions and variable descriptions.

- **Testing `elegant-dark`**: 
  - The `generateAndPostContent.ts` script is NOT directly compatible with `elegant-dark` due to differing template variable structures (e.g., `mainHeading` vs. `emotionalHook`).
  - To generate a sample of `elegant-dark` without posting, use the dedicated example script: `src/examples/elegant-dark-example.ts`. This script provides the correct variables for this template.
  - (Future enhancement: Modify `generateAndPostContent.ts` or create a new job script to make `elegant-dark` compatible with the automated content generation workflow.)

- **Enhanced `generateAndPostContent.ts` for Template Variable Flexibility**:
  - Modified `src/config/templateConfig.ts`:
    - Added an optional `contentMapping: { [key: string]: string }` field to the `Template` interface.
    - This mapping defines how EJS variables in a template should be populated from generated content (e.g., `mainHeading: "emotionalHook"`) or other sources (e.g., `accentText: "topic"`).
    - Implemented `contentMapping` for the new `elegant-dark` template and the existing `self-love-gradient` template.
  - Modified `src/jobs/generateAndPostContent.ts`:
    - The script now reads the `contentMapping` for the selected template.
    - If a mapping exists, it dynamically constructs the variables object to be passed to `generateImage` based on these mappings.
    - This allows templates with different EJS variable names (like `elegant-dark`) to correctly receive data from the content generation process (which typically produces `emotionalHook`, `actionStep`, `emotionalReward`).
    - If no `contentMapping` is found for a template, the script falls back to its previous behavior of directly assigning `emotionalHook`, etc.
    - This change makes the system more adaptable, allowing `dailyPostScheduler.ts` to correctly use templates with diverse variable structures, including `elegant-dark`.

## In Progress
- Research and planning for video generation with audio
- Evaluating model performance and quality

## To Do
- Create prototype for converting static templates to video format
- Implement basic audio selection algorithm
- Set up audio library infrastructure
- Test Instagram Reels API integration
- Evaluate and compare free model performance

## Notes
- The template creation guide is now available in the memory-bank directory
- The guide provides all necessary information for developers to create new templates without breaking the existing system
- Audio integration documentation is available in the memory-bank/features/audio-integration directory
- Free open-source models like Mistral and Llama are now used via OpenRouter for content generation
- Optimal posting times were implemented based on research showing the best times to post on Instagram for each day of the week
- Instagram Story posting now available with 9:16 aspect ratio support
- Content generation has been completely revamped to focus on authentic empathy and real human struggles instead of viral marketing tactics with made-up statistics:
  - Updated system prompts to emphasize genuine empathy and understanding
  - Replaced shocking statements with relatable questions
  - Removed made-up statistics (like "91% of to-do lists fail...")
  - Added more realistic, achievable 5-minute actions
  - Created more conversational tone throughout all content
  - Implemented test script to verify empathetic content generation
  - Updated mock content templates to align with new authentic approach

## New Features

- **Added "elegant-dark" Template**: A new Instagram post template (`src/templates/elegant-dark`) has been added. 
  - **Theme**: Sophisticated dark theme with a dark gradient background.
  - **Typography**: Uses premium Google Fonts: `Playfair Display` for main headings, `Montserrat` for subheadings and body text, and `Satisfy` for accent text.
  - **Colors**: Features rich accent colors like soft gold (`#B08D57`) and deep teal (`#00695C`) for visual appeal against the dark background.
  - **Layout**: Emphasizes clean spacing and a clear visual hierarchy for a calm, premium user experience.
  - **Variables**: Supports dynamic content through EJS variables: `mainHeading`, `subHeading`, `bodyText`, `accentText`, `handle`, and `date`.
  - **Configuration**: Registered in `src/config/templateConfig.ts` with default values.
  - **Documentation**: Includes a `README.md` in its directory with usage instructions and variable descriptions.

- **Testing `elegant-dark`**: 
  - The `generateAndPostContent.ts` script is NOT directly compatible with `elegant-dark` due to differing template variable structures (e.g., `mainHeading` vs. `emotionalHook`).
  - To generate a sample of `elegant-dark` without posting, use the dedicated example script: `src/examples/elegant-dark-example.ts`. This script provides the correct variables for this template.
  - (Future enhancement: Modify `generateAndPostContent.ts` or create a new job script to make `elegant-dark` compatible with the automated content generation workflow.)

- **Enhanced `generateAndPostContent.ts` for Template Variable Flexibility**:
  - Modified `src/config/templateConfig.ts`:
    - Added an optional `contentMapping: { [key: string]: string }` field to the `Template` interface.
    - This mapping defines how EJS variables in a template should be populated from generated content (e.g., `mainHeading: "emotionalHook"`) or other sources (e.g., `accentText: "topic"`).
    - Implemented `contentMapping` for the new `elegant-dark` template and the existing `self-love-gradient` template.
  - Modified `src/jobs/generateAndPostContent.ts`:
    - The script now reads the `contentMapping` for the selected template.
    - If a mapping exists, it dynamically constructs the variables object to be passed to `generateImage` based on these mappings.
    - This allows templates with different EJS variable names (like `elegant-dark`) to correctly receive data from the content generation process (which typically produces `emotionalHook`, `actionStep`, `emotionalReward`).
    - If no `contentMapping` is found for a template, the script falls back to its previous behavior of directly assigning `emotionalHook`, etc.
    - This change makes the system more adaptable, allowing `dailyPostScheduler.ts` to correctly use templates with diverse variable structures, including `elegant-dark`.

  - (Future enhancement: Modify `generateAndPostContent.ts` or create a new job script to make `elegant-dark` compatible with the automated content generation workflow.)

- **Enhanced `generateAndPostContent.ts` for Template Variable Flexibility**:
  - Modified `src/config/templateConfig.ts`:
    - Added an optional `contentMapping: { [key: string]: string }` field to the `Template` interface.
    - This mapping defines how EJS variables in a template should be populated from generated content (e.g., `mainHeading: "emotionalHook"`) or other sources (e.g., `accentText: "topic"`).
    - Implemented `contentMapping` for the new `elegant-dark` template and the existing `self-love-gradient` template.
  - Modified `src/jobs/generateAndPostContent.ts`:
    - The script now reads the `contentMapping` for the selected template.
    - If a mapping exists, it dynamically constructs the variables object to be passed to `generateImage` based on these mappings.
    - This allows templates with different EJS variable names (like `elegant-dark`) to correctly receive data from the content generation process (which typically produces `emotionalHook`, `actionStep`, `emotionalReward`).
    - If no `contentMapping` is found for a template, the script falls back to its previous behavior of directly assigning `emotionalHook`, etc.
    - This change makes the system more adaptable, allowing `dailyPostScheduler.ts` to correctly use templates with diverse variable structures, including `elegant-dark`.

## New Features

- **Added "elegant-dark" Template**: A new Instagram post template (`src/templates/elegant-dark`) has been added. 
  - **Theme**: Sophisticated dark theme with a dark gradient background.
  - **Typography**: Uses premium Google Fonts: `Playfair Display` for main headings, `Montserrat` for subheadings and body text, and `Satisfy` for accent text.
  - **Colors**: Features rich accent colors like soft gold (`#B08D57`) and deep teal (`#00695C`) for visual appeal against the dark background.
  - **Layout**: Emphasizes clean spacing and a clear visual hierarchy for a calm, premium user experience.
  - **Variables**: Supports dynamic content through EJS variables: `mainHeading`, `subHeading`, `bodyText`, `accentText`, `handle`, and `date`.
  - **Configuration**: Registered in `src/config/templateConfig.ts` with default values.
  - **Documentation**: Includes a `README.md` in its directory with usage instructions and variable descriptions.

## In Progress
- Research and planning for video generation with audio
- Evaluating model performance and quality

## To Do
- Create prototype for converting static templates to video format
- Implement basic audio selection algorithm
- Set up audio library infrastructure
- Test Instagram Reels API integration
- Evaluate and compare free model performance

## Notes
- The template creation guide is now available in the memory-bank directory
- The guide provides all necessary information for developers to create new templates without breaking the existing system
- Audio integration documentation is available in the memory-bank/features/audio-integration directory
- Free open-source models like Mistral and Llama are now used via OpenRouter for content generation
- Optimal posting times were implemented based on research showing the best times to post on Instagram for each day of the week
- Instagram Story posting now available with 9:16 aspect ratio support
- Content generation has been completely revamped to focus on authentic empathy and real human struggles instead of viral marketing tactics with made-up statistics:
  - Updated system prompts to emphasize genuine empathy and understanding
  - Replaced shocking statements with relatable questions
  - Removed made-up statistics (like "91% of to-do lists fail...")
  - Added more realistic, achievable 5-minute actions
  - Created more conversational tone throughout all content
  - Implemented test script to verify empathetic content generation
  - Updated mock content templates to align with new authentic approach

## New Features

- **Added "elegant-dark" Template**: A new Instagram post template (`src/templates/elegant-dark`) has been added. 
  - **Theme**: Sophisticated dark theme with a dark gradient background.
  - **Typography**: Uses premium Google Fonts: `Playfair Display` for main headings, `Montserrat` for subheadings and body text, and `Satisfy` for accent text.
  - **Colors**: Features rich accent colors like soft gold (`#B08D57`) and deep teal (`#00695C`) for visual appeal against the dark background.
  - **Layout**: Emphasizes clean spacing and a clear visual hierarchy for a calm, premium user experience.
  - **Variables**: Supports dynamic content through EJS variables: `mainHeading`, `subHeading`, `bodyText`, `accentText`, `handle`, and `date`.
  - **Configuration**: Registered in `src/config/templateConfig.ts` with default values.
  - **Documentation**: Includes a `README.md` in its directory with usage instructions and variable descriptions.

- **Testing `elegant-dark`**: 
  - The `generateAndPostContent.ts` script is NOT directly compatible with `elegant-dark` due to differing template variable structures (e.g., `mainHeading` vs. `emotionalHook`).
  - To generate a sample of `elegant-dark` without posting, use the dedicated example script: `src/examples/elegant-dark-example.ts`. This script provides the correct variables for this template.
  - (Future enhancement: Modify `generateAndPostContent.ts` or create a new job script to make `elegant-dark` compatible with the automated content generation workflow.)

- **Enhanced `generateAndPostContent.ts` for Template Variable Flexibility**:
  - Modified `src/config/templateConfig.ts`:
    - Added an optional `contentMapping: { [key: string]: string }` field to the `Template` interface.
    - This mapping defines how EJS variables in a template should be populated from generated content (e.g., `mainHeading: "emotionalHook"`) or other sources (e.g., `accentText: "topic"`).
    - Implemented `contentMapping` for the new `elegant-dark` template and the existing `self-love-gradient` template.
  - Modified `src/jobs/generateAndPostContent.ts`:
    - The script now reads the `contentMapping` for the selected template.
    - If a mapping exists, it dynamically constructs the variables object to be passed to `generateImage` based on these mappings.
    - This allows templates with different EJS variable names (like `elegant-dark`) to correctly receive data from the content generation process (which typically produces `emotionalHook`, `actionStep`, `emotionalReward`).
    - If no `contentMapping` is found for a template, the script falls back to its previous behavior of directly assigning `emotionalHook`, etc.
    - This change makes the system more adaptable, allowing `dailyPostScheduler.ts` to correctly use templates with diverse variable structures, including `elegant-dark`.

    - This allows templates with different EJS variable names (like `elegant-dark`) to correctly receive data from the content generation process (which typically produces `emotionalHook`, `actionStep`, `emotionalReward`).
    - If no `contentMapping` is found for a template, the script falls back to its previous behavior of directly assigning `emotionalHook`, etc.
    - This change makes the system more adaptable, allowing `dailyPostScheduler.ts` to correctly use templates with diverse variable structures, including `elegant-dark`.

## New Features

- **Added "elegant-dark" Template**: A new Instagram post template (`src/templates/elegant-dark`) has been added. 
  - **Theme**: Sophisticated dark theme with a dark gradient background.
  - **Typography**: Uses premium Google Fonts: `Playfair Display` for main headings, `Montserrat` for subheadings and body text, and `Satisfy` for accent text.
  - **Colors**: Features rich accent colors like soft gold (`#B08D57`) and deep teal (`#00695C`) for visual appeal against the dark background.
  - **Layout**: Emphasizes clean spacing and a clear visual hierarchy for a calm, premium user experience.
  - **Variables**: Supports dynamic content through EJS variables: `mainHeading`, `subHeading`, `bodyText`, `accentText`, `handle`, and `date`.
  - **Configuration**: Registered in `src/config/templateConfig.ts` with default values.
  - **Documentation**: Includes a `README.md` in its directory with usage instructions and variable descriptions.

- **Testing `elegant-dark`**: 
  - The `generateAndPostContent.ts` script is NOT directly compatible with `elegant-dark` due to differing template variable structures (e.g., `mainHeading` vs. `emotionalHook`).
  - To generate a sample of `elegant-dark` without posting, use the dedicated example script: `src/examples/elegant-dark-example.ts`. This script provides the correct variables for this template.
  - (Future enhancement: Modify `generateAndPostContent.ts` or create a new job script to make `elegant-dark` compatible with the automated content generation workflow.)

- **Enhanced `generateAndPostContent.ts` for Template Variable Flexibility**:
  - Modified `src/config/templateConfig.ts`:
    - Added an optional `contentMapping: { [key: string]: string }` field to the `Template` interface.
    - This mapping defines how EJS variables in a template should be populated from generated content (e.g., `mainHeading: "emotionalHook"`) or other sources (e.g., `accentText: "topic"`).
    - Implemented `contentMapping` for the new `elegant-dark` template and the existing `self-love-gradient` template.
  - Modified `src/jobs/generateAndPostContent.ts`:
    - The script now reads the `contentMapping` for the selected template.
    - If a mapping exists, it dynamically constructs the variables object to be passed to `generateImage` based on these mappings.
    - This allows templates with different EJS variable names (like `elegant-dark`) to correctly receive data from the content generation process (which typically produces `emotionalHook`, `actionStep`, `emotionalReward`).
